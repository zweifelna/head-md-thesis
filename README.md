# MA Media Design: MD2 Thesis

This is the boilerplate to fork in order to kickstart your thesis. It is composed of four folders that will enable us to follow your progression during the your thesis time: from April to December. In this Github repository, you will find four folders:

```
INSPIRATION
METHOD
DATA
OUTPUT
```
These folders correspond to the following:

In the INSPIRATION folder on GitHub, upload (1) a .md file with a list of terms/topics and their definition and 3 potential research questions, (2) at least 10 academic resources (articles, book chapters) about your topics, (3) visuals about what you are interested in.

In the METHOD folder on GitHub, upload a .md file that describes your research question, a motivation to explore it with references to literature/ projects as well as the methodology you chose, as well as clarifications about it (number of interviews, places you’ll observe, etc.)

In the DATA folder on GitHub, upload the material you produced and collected, prepare a 10 minutes presentation to walk us through this (no slides, only by using a selection of the material)

In the OUTPUT folder on GitHub, upload the various iterations of your masters thesis text, as well as the images you want to use
