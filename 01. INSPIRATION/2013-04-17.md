# INSPIRATION

## Potential questions
1. How can TUIs be used to create adaptive, personalized storytelling experiences that respond to individual users' preferences, emotions, or behaviors?
2. What are the design principles and TUI features that enable effective TUI-based game mechanics, providing users with more intuitive and engaging ways of interacting with game elements?
3. How can TUIs be integrated with other gaming technologies to create more immersive and engaging gaming experiences?

## List of terms/topics
1. Tangible Interaction: The concept of interacting with digital information through physical objects and environments, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
2. Embodied Interaction: The idea that users' bodily actions, gestures, and movements play a crucial role in their interaction with digital systems, including TUI-based narratives.
3. Graspable Interfaces: A type of TUI design that emphasizes direct manipulation and physical embodiment of digital information, making it more intuitive and engaging for users.
4. Mixed Reality Storytelling: The use of TUIs and other technologies to create storytelling experiences that seamlessly blend physical and digital elements, enhancing immersion and engagement.
5. Nonlinear Narratives: Storytelling structures that allow users to actively shape the story's progression by making choices or interacting with the narrative elements, often supported by TUIs.
6. Adaptive Storytelling: Narratives that dynamically change based on individual users' preferences, emotions, or behaviors, potentially enabled by TUIs collecting and interpreting user data.
7. Collaborative Storytelling: Storytelling experiences involve multiple users co-creating and exploring stories together, often facilitated by TUIs that support group interaction.
8. Multimodal Interaction: The integration of various interaction modalities (e.g., touch, gesture, speech) in TUI-based storytelling experiences, providing a more natural and intuitive user experience.
9. Haptic Feedback: The use of tactile sensations, such as vibrations or force feedback, to provide users with information about their interactions with TUI-based narrative elements.
10. Augmented Reality (AR): The overlay of digital information onto the physical world, often used in conjunction with TUIs to enhance storytelling experiences by blending real and virtual elements.
11. Context-aware Computing: The ability of TUI-based systems to gather and interpret information about their environment and users, enabling more personalized and adaptive storytelling experiences.
12. Affordances: The perceived properties of TUI elements that suggest possible actions and interactions for users, shaping the design and functionality of TUI-based storytelling systems.
13. Gestural Interaction: The use of hand gestures and body movements as input methods for TUI-based storytelling systems, providing a more natural and expressive way of interacting with digital narratives.
14. User Experience (UX) Design: The process of designing TUI-based storytelling systems that are usable, engaging, and satisfying for users, considering aspects such as usability, aesthetics, and emotional appeal.
15. Evaluation Methods: Techniques and methodologies for assessing the effectiveness, usability, and user satisfaction of TUI-based storytelling systems, such as user studies, interviews, or heuristic evaluation.
16. WIMP: Windows, icons, menus, and pointers
17. Post-WIMP
18. Tangible bits
19. Object mapping
