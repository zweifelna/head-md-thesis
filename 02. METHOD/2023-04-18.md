## Motivation

My motivation for exploring the world of non-standard controllers for video games is rooted in a desire to understand how technology can challenge and reshape the conventions of gaming interaction. I am captivated by the ways in which these controllers defy traditional norms and push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of player engagement, accessibility, and immersion. Through this research, I aim to gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate relationship between game design, controller innovation, and player experiences, with the ultimate goal of contributing to a more diverse and dynamic gaming landscape.
