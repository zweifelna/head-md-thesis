## Motivation

My motivation for exploring the world of non-standard controllers for video games is rooted in a desire to understand how technology can challenge and reshape the conventions of gaming interaction. I am captivated by the ways in which these controllers defy traditional norms and push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of player engagement, accessibility, and immersion. Through this research, I aim to gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate relationship between game design, controller innovation, and player experiences, with the ultimate goal of contributing to a more diverse and dynamic gaming landscape.

## Methodology
- Archival Research: Delve into archives, both online and offline, to find historical documentation, articles, advertisements, and patents related to alternative controllers.

- Literature Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of academic literature, including research papers, books, and conference proceedings, to gather insights into the history and impact of alternative controllers.

- Expert Interviews: Interview game designers, developers, or industry experts who have experience with alternative controllers.

- Case Studies: Select a few key alternative controllers (such as the Nintendo Power Glove, the Guitar Hero controller, or the Wii Remote) and perform in-depth case studies to understand their development, functionality, and influence on the gaming industry (including analyzing marketing materials, reviews, and user feedback, as well as examining the games that utilized these controllers).

- Comparative Analysis: Compare and contrast different alternative controllers to identify common features, design principles, and trends. This can help to understand the broader context of alternative controller development and reveal patterns in their adoption and implementation across different platforms and time periods.
